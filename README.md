## What is VersionEye? 

VersionEye is a cross-platform search engine for open source software libraries. Currently we track more than 250K open source libraries from Java, Ruby, Python, Node.JS, PHP, JavaScript, R and Clojure. Soon we will add .NET, Object-C and other languages.

You can follow any of the 250K open source libraries on VersionEye and we will notify you as soon the next version is released. VersionEye helps you to stay up-to-date.

In additional to the search and follow feature, VersionEye can actively monitor your source code and notify you about outdated dependencies in your project. Beside that it shows you which licenses your dependencies are using.
